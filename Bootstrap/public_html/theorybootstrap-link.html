There are two ways to start using Bootstrap on your own web site.

You can:

Download Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com
Include Bootstrap from a CDN

Downloading Bootstrap
If you want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, go to getbootstrap.com, and follow the instructions there.

Bootstrap CDN
If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

MaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery:

MaxCDN:
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- jQuery library -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

<!-- Latest compiled JavaScript -->
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
